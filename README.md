# Surfs_Up

## Overview
This study was done to check sustainability of a year round business of the surf and ice cream shop year round.  This was done by checking the temperate statistics during the december and june months.   

## Results
Below are two pictures showing the results of the june and december temperature statistics in fahrenheit. <br />
June <br />

## Summary of Results
* the mean temperate is within 4 degrees
* both have adequate samples sizes at over 1500 data points
* both maximum temperatures are within 1 degree of 84
* december could be slower as the minimum temparture appears to have an outlier in the 50s, widening the standard deviation

## Additional Diligence
I believe by seperating these queries into years and plotting these box and whisker plots by year we could get a better visualization of the data over time.  The December mins could be resulting of one outlier year, skewing the data.  Also, it would be important to incorperate the precipitation into the planning.  With more rain maybe people would surf more from bigger swells but eat less ice cream.  Thus we could plan inventory around the predicatable weather means.
